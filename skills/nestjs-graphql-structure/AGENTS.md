## Abstract

File-placement and anatomy guide for NestJS GraphQL applications, designed for AI agents and LLMs. Teaches where every file belongs in a feature-first, code-first codebase — the base structure map plus per-file rules for modules, services, resolvers, inputs, entities, repositories, loaders, and events — each with purpose, responsibilities, and incorrect-vs-correct examples. It also covers how modules connect to resolve GraphQL fields and relations, including module-resolution concerns such as circular dependencies, while deferring behavioral concerns to the nestjs-best-practices skill.

### 1.1 Canonical Application Structure

**Impact: CRITICAL** — the map every other placement rule hangs from

**Purpose.** This is the base map for a feature-first, code-first NestJS GraphQL application.
It shows where every kind of file belongs, at the application level and inside a feature
module. Consult it first when deciding where a new file goes; then read the per-file rule for
that kind of file for its purpose, responsibilities, and examples.

**How to read it.** `common/` holds reusable, feature-agnostic building blocks; `infra/` holds
one-time infrastructure imported by the composition root; `modules/<feature>/` holds one
bounded context each, and every *kind* of file inside it gets its own subfolder. Files marked
`OPTIONAL` exist only in the situations their rule describes.

```

**Consequences of the map.**

- A feature owns its own files; moving or deleting a feature is moving or deleting one folder.
- Cross-cutting code is never duplicated into features — it lives in `common/`.
- A new file kind is placed by its *role*, not by the feature it happens to serve first.
